0,39.0,4844.0,"ANTI-ODOR AND ANTI-SWEAT TECHNOLOGY

The Insider Tech T-Shirt is made from breathable fabric that absorbs and evaporates sweat quickly. So it doesn't just help control body temperature, it also avoids any unpleasant sweat rings under your armpits.


Our advanced fabric also offers antibacterial technology. This means that it can inhibit the growth of the bacteria which can cause unpleasant odors throughout the day. That is why we refer to the Tech T-Shirt as the anti-odor and anti-sweat t-shirt.

Insider's products are made to last. For that reason, we chose a high-durability technology to prevent color fading, even after several washes.

A FABRIC WITH LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

The Tech T-Shirt is made from modal fabric, which is produced from reforested wood. The production of just one modal t-shirt uses four times less water than a cotton one, saving 2,000 liters per item.

On top of all that, it's insecticide and pesticide-free. Although the production of conventional cotton occupies only 2.4% of the planet's planted area, it accounts for 11% of the pesticides and 25% of the insecticides used in agriculture worldwide.

VERSATILITY FOR YOUR DAILY ROUTINE

We know how hard it is to keep cool and fresh in warm conditions. That's why we develop technological clothing to ensure you are comfortable even when temperatures rise.

This black Tech T-shirt is elegant and minimalist, a great choice for casual appointments, whilst the vibrant colors in our range bring a modern touch, whether they are styled with jeans or twill pants.

The Tech T-shirt is also a great choice for evening engagements, either paired with a modern jacket or a classic all-black look.

GET TO KNOW OUR ESSENTIALS

Insider's products are essential for comfortable, odor- and sweat-free daily use. Our breathable technology is to be found in our casual, sports and underwear lines.

We invest in textile technology to create high-end sustainable products, whilst embracing a clean, local and efficient supply chain. In addition to modal fabric, we also use biodegradable polyamine in certain products, such as our Performance T-Shirt, an advanced sports top designed to help you achieve your best. Our Tech T-Shirt has been developed to make life easier for healthy living every day. It doesn't need to be ironed, it won't leave you feeling too hot and it offers anti-odor technology. Thanks to its breathability, you can experience long-lasting comfort and enjoyment. This t-shirt is an essential item for everyday wear, whether you are in an office or enjoying the outdoors.",Tech T-Shirt,"{'Black': ['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL', 'XXLL'], 'Blue': ['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'], 'Off White': ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'], 'Nori Green': ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'], 'Indigo': ['S', 'M', 'XL', 'XXL'], 'Carmenere': ['XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL'], 'Grey': ['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL']}"

Our fabric also avoids unpleasant odors caused by microorganisms. Sweat, despite being a natural mechanism of the body, can obtain a bad smell when in contact with bacteria on the skin. By blocking the growth of those bacteria with its antibacterial action, our Tech T-Shirt V Neck will help to prevent bad odors throughout the day.

Low environmental impact fabric

The Tech T-Shirt V Neck is made from modal fabric, which comes from reforested wood. One t-shirt made out of modal fabric uses 4x less water than a cotton one to be produced, a saving of 2000 liters per piece.

In addition, it is insecticide and pesticide free, as opposed to conventional cotton, whose production, despite occupying only 2.4% of the planet's planted area, accounts for 11% of the pesticides and 25% of the insecticides usage in agriculture worldwide.

However, the solution is not practical at all. After all, it is necessary to take and place the pieces several times a day. Therefore, it is important to wear technological clothing, capable of adapting to variations in temperature.

Our long sleeve t-shirt quickly absorbs and evaporates sweat. Thus, the breathability of the piece prevents the feeling of suffocation. Plus, you can avoid sweat stains and the feeling of dampness on frosty days.

Noble and sustainable fiber

The Tech T-Shirt Long Sleeve, long sleeve shirt from Insider, is produced with modal, a noble and ultra-pleasant fiber. It acts directly on regulation and thermal comfort, offering excellent levels of breathability. In addition, the fabric prevents the proliferation of bacteria that cause bad odor.

Modal goes through a sustainable cyclical process. During production, the waste recovery rate is 95%. Furthermore, it is biodegradable and compostable, facilitating disposal and reducing negative impacts on nature.



Design and versatility

Insider's long sleeve t-shirt is a minimalist blouse. It has a U-shaped bald collar that causes a nice visual effect highlighting the shoulders. The neckline is not very hollow and offers good protection for the chest, an important feature for cold days.

The long-sleeved black t-shirt can be combined with sweatpants or jogger pants, creating laid-back looks. It also works with twill bottoms for an office look. There are several good matches for a great, well-balanced look for many different occasions.

In other words, it keeps everything in place, without tightening! That is why they are called the perfect underwear: they are comfortable and also functional.

They can also be considered eco-friendly, because they require four times less water than traditional cotton underwear. The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, so it is important for us to use processes that are less aggressive to the environment.

How long does the protection last after home washing?

The anti-viral protection is guaranteed for at least 50 washes, and may extend depending on the aggressiveness of the wash.

What is the advantage of an antiviral application on a garment such as a t-shirt?

By using a t-shirt with antiviral application, cross contamination is avoided, i.e., when having contact with a contaminated person, the person wearing the t-shirt with antiviral protection does not take this contamination to his home, to the laundry, or to himself by rubbing his hand on the t-shirt and then on his face.

How does the antiviral fabric act against viruses?

In 2 ways: 1) By breaking the bilipidic layer of the virus causing the viral DNA/RNA, when exposed to the environment, to reduce its infectious capacity. 2) By blocking the binding of the virus in the host cells, thus preventing the virus from releasing its genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside them, reducing its infectious capacity in the cells.

Are there any side effects of this antiviral application on human health?

No, our product is non-cytotoxic, with stabilizers of vegetable origin and internationally validated technology through ISO 18 184, AATCC 100, and ASTM E 2149 certifications. Insider's Daily T-Shirt is proven effective against viruses with a reduction of up to 99.9% against the strains tested, according to ISO 18184 (Textiles: Determination of antiviral activity of textile products).

Another important factor that makes all the difference when it comes to health and personal hygiene is the antibacterial property of the fabric. It prevents the proliferation of odor-causing bacteria. In addition, the anti-sweating characteristic is achieved by the absorption and rapid evaporation of sweat, avoiding the feeling of dampness.

Briefs for a comfortable and safe routine

A busy routine requires quality garments that make daily life more practical. Even in the period of high temperatures, some attires still demand the use of formal (and hot) clothes. In these cases, the need for technological underwear increases as a solution for excessive dampness and bad smells that can impact confidence and comfort.

Insider's underwear is the ideal choice, because unlike a cotton brief, it absorbs and evaporates sweat quickly, avoiding embarrassing stains. In addition, the technology of the piece ensures that everything stays in place firmly, but without tightness.

Conscious and sustainable consumption

The processes adopted in the production of slip underwear are sustainable, since the fabric is made of the first biodegradable polyamide ever developed. Thus, it is possible to guarantee the necessary comfort for the day-to-day and, at the same time, reduce the impact on the environment.

How long does the protection last after home washing?

The anti-viral protection is guaranteed for at least 50 washes, and may extend depending on the aggressiveness of the wash.

What is the advantage of an antiviral application on a garment such as a t-shirt?

By using a t-shirt with antiviral application, cross contamination is avoided, i.e., when having contact with a contaminated person, the person wearing the t-shirt with antiviral protection does not take this contamination to his home, to the laundry, or to himself by rubbing his hand on the t-shirt and then on his face.

How does the antiviral fabric act against viruses?

In 2 ways: 1) By breaking the bilipidic layer of the virus causing the viral DNA/RNA, when exposed to the environment, to reduce its infectious capacity. 2) By blocking the binding of the virus in the host cells, thus preventing the virus from releasing its genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside them, reducing its infectious capacity in the cells.

Are there any side effects of this antiviral application on human health?

No, our product is non-cytotoxic, with stabilizers of vegetable origin and internationally validated technology through ISO 18 184, AATCC 100, and ASTM E 2149 certifications. Insider's Daily T-Shirt is proven effective against viruses with a reduction of up to 99.9% against the strains tested, according to ISO 18184 (Textiles: Determination of antiviral activity of textile products).
